I’m sick of "deserve"<br>
There’s what I want, and what I have<br>
Missed my meds, but the feeling’s still me<br>
Same thoughts, amplified<br>
Surely unhealthy, but the cure isn’t a take-home<br>
Or some well-meaning middle-aged woman<br>
Maybe it’s a whole box of croissants today<br>
Recounting all my oughts today<br>
Revisiting old haunts today<br>
I have a cat and crescent moon<br>
Some interchangeable friends<br>
A dry routine and stale amends<br>
Crash out on weekday weekends
