Am I leaning in, legs dangling over barstools in a recess of my mind<br>
Or maybe I’m sitting in the kiddy pool, breaking surface tension, feeling it reseal<br>
Maybe I’m painting over used canvas with rememory and hindsight<br>
Maybe it wasn’t my fault<br>
Maybe I shouldn’t be a regular in this part of the amygdala<br>
Maybe sage is the bully bearing down from the docks<br>
And maybe, he's a lesson for knitting life from a pattern
