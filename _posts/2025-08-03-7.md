The deterrents to disclosing the unfiltered contents of my life to my mother are so intangible, I find myself making an innocent offering every now and then, just to reinforce them. Without fail, she accepts these with such evenness, I can’t imagine her inner reaction to be anything other than bewilderment. With my sister, I often feel that I’m asking for insights from a small child—she does her best to mimic what she’s heard, dripped in naïveté and stripped of nuance. My mother, however, makes me feel as though I’m soliciting directions from the blind—she’d like to help, but hasn’t the capacity, wouldn’t know where to start.<br><br>

It’s odd, too, the things she remembers (or forgets). My life’s direction, its more monumental events, these are rarely captured. Bumps in the road, the insignificances I choose to forget—these are deeply etched.
