I couldn’t have dreamed up a fate more fitting<br>
Than a long string of failures<br>
A repeat offender with a tail between her legs<br><br>

Peeling from my shirt, and standing soaked in all the runoff<br>
Waters won’t be clear no matter how much you unearth<br>
Talk me up and down, extend a hand to this black mirror<br><br>

I don’t have what you want from me now<br>
