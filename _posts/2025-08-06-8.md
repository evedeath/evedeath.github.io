I can never shake the feeling I’m destined to die early<br>
Things haven’t gotten so dramatic yet, but one day, push will shove me<br>
One day, while I’m busy reciting the old truths,<br>
That the pure-hearted ones I loved deserve happiness<br>
(Mutually exclusive to my presence in their lives)<br>
That I would only find comfort in my sorrow<br>
One day, when I owe it all to no one<br>
I can drift off, as coolly planned as that surgery whose scalpel thrust me into this world<br>
Feelings of all sorts come in pulses, unreliably, transiently<br>
I’ve felt these to varying degrees, and now my cup is full<br>
My mind strains like crystal, misplaced in the wash<br>
Drains with no hope of holding much for long<br>
Let me sit in Merricat’s castle with the other precious fragments<br>
Let me decay
