I’m learning it’s better to say nothing than one thing<br>
That restarts the clock as we wait for the next<br>
I keep thinking someday it’ll all be the same<br>
As it was; until then, I will wait for the text<br>
That never comes<br>
There’s nothing to run from, my life is as much here as it would be anywhere<br>
I’m learning to sit with myself<br>
And other strangers
