I never stopped loving you, just missed these glacial changes<br>
Think you only ever loved my name as printed on the pages<br>
Like a child, I looked up to your face 'til it was stricken<br>
And I'm always going to wonder where I'd be if your lip split then<br><br>

Did I mean the world to you?<br>
Do I mean a thing to anyone who even fucking matters to me now?
