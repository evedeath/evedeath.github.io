My life is held together now by dollar-store epoxy<br>
'Cause I'm not sure that I'm worth investing in<br><br>

The silence at the start is always telling<br>
But I pretend I don't hear it<br>
Or I'll have to begin again<br><br>

The half-life of every knot I tie is splitting<br>
And if I had to start the bidding<br>
I'd say what do you want, in the end?
