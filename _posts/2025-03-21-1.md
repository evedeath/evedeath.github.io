The truth?<br>
I can't stand the quiet<br>
On waking, I take in strays<br>
See how doting and grateful?<br>
But by night, I'm a waif<br>
Lock the door, start the tap<br>
I keep backing up the drain<br>
And reconciling in the mirror<br>
I keep filling up on weightless words<br>
Side-by-side the hard pill
